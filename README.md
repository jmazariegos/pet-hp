# PET HP

This project was made using React.

I thought I want to learn React and my brother showed this video from [Brian David Gilbert](https://www.polygon.com/videos/2019/9/9/20849172/unraveled-how-to-calculate-pet-hp-hit-points) where he 
calculated a pet's hp and while there is one already a website in existence I thought what if it told me what was the best suited class for my pet, so I made it!

For calculations all formulas and values are in the link above, but the general idea is that you put in your pet and class
and depending on what you see your pet do during the amount of time you study it for will determine how much HP and what their level is.

For my little addon, you can add to all 5 classes tallies to find out which class your pet is most like while still being
able to choose their class instead still.

Made sure to not look at anything but my mind and google so that I could ensure any questions I had were being taught to me.
